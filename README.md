## About The Project
<img alt="Dashboard of the page" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AitorGarciaM/BugAndPlan/main/Readme/Images/Dashboard.PNG" height="216" width="400" align="center">

There are many great BugTrackers but I didn't find one that implements a Project Manager, so I decided to create one that include it.
Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be loosing time copy pasting tasks form the BugTracker to your scrum backlog

At this time the project manager it's not included, but I'll be adding features in my free time, like the project manager or other 
specified in the Roadmap. You may also suggest changes by forking this repository and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
